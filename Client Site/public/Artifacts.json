        "Description": "Originating in Egypt’s Old Kingdom (circa 2686–2181 BCE), papyrus scrolls were a cornerstone of ancient Egyptian civilization, enabling the documentation of a highly organized society. Crafted in the Nile Delta’s marshes, where the Cyperus papyrus plant thrived, these scrolls were used by scribes trained in specialized schools at Memphis and Thebes. They recorded everything from tax records to religious rituals, supporting Egypt’s centralized bureaucracy, which managed labor for monumental projects like the pyramids. Papyrus production was a significant industry, with scrolls exported to Greece, the Levant, and Mesopotamia, influencing the development of early books like the codex. Their use persisted through the New Kingdom and beyond, shaping Egypt’s role as a cultural and intellectual hub in the ancient world.",
